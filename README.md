# Etch-A-Sketch

Made with using javascript, html and css.

Initially gives the user a 16x16 pixel interface, where hovering on an individual element (invisible) gives a random color with an opacity that keeps increasing until it hits 1 (10 times hover over the element is required!).

The Reset button can be used to specify the number of pixels required by the user, for the sake of practically the limit is between 1 to 100 (both inclusive) and the code is implemented such that the user has to choose between 1 and 100
